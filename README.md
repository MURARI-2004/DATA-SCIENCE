Step 1: Importing necessary Python libraries.
We will be using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

Step 2: Creating the data frame.
You can download the dataset from here.

dataframe = pd.read_csv("/content/Zomato-data-.csv")
print(dataframe.head())

Step 3: Data Cleaning and Preparation
Before moving further we need to clean and process the data.

1. Convert the rate column to a float by removing denominator characters.

dataframe['rate']=dataframe['rate'].apply(handleRate): 

def handleRate(value):
    value=str(value).split('/')
    value=value[0];
    return float(value)
​
dataframe['rate']=dataframe['rate'].apply(handleRate)
print(dataframe.head())

Converting rate column to float
2. Getting summary of the dataframe use df.info().

dataframe.info()

3. Checking for missing or null values to identify any data gaps.

print(dataframe.isnull().sum())

Step 4: Exploring Restaurant Types
1. Let's see the listed_in (type) column to identify popular restaurant categories.

sns.countplot(x=dataframe['listed_in(type)'])
plt.xlabel("Type of restaurant")

2. Votes by Restaurant Type
Here we get the count of votes for each category.

grouped_data = dataframe.groupby('listed_in(type)')['votes'].sum()
result = pd.DataFrame({'votes': grouped_data})
plt.plot(result, c='green', marker='o')
plt.xlabel('Type of restaurant')
plt.ylabel('Votes')

Step 5: Identify the Most Voted Restaurant
Find the restaurant with the highest number of votes.

max_votes = dataframe['votes'].max()
restaurant_with_max_votes = dataframe.loc[dataframe['votes'] == max_votes, 'name']
​
print('Restaurant(s) with the maximum votes:')
print(restaurant_with_max_votes)

sns.countplot(x=dataframe['online_order'])

Step 7: Analyze Ratings
Checking the distribution of ratings from the rate column.

plt.hist(dataframe['rate'],bins=5)
plt.title('Ratings Distribution')
plt.show()

Step 8: Approximate Cost for Couples
Analyze the approx_cost(for two people) column to find the preferred price range.

couple_data=dataframe['approx_cost(for two people)']
sns.countplot(x=couple_data)

Step 9: Ratings Comparison - Online vs Offline Orders
Compare ratings between restaurants that accept online orders and those that don't.

plt.figure(figsize = (6,6))
sns.boxplot(x = 'online_order', y = 'rate', data = dataframe)

Step 10: Order Mode Preferences by Restaurant Type
Find the relationship between order mode (online_order) and restaurant type (listed_in(type)).

pivot_table = dataframe.pivot_table(index='listed_in(type)', columns='online_order', aggfunc='size', fill_value=0):
pivot_table = dataframe.pivot_table(index='listed_in(type)', columns='online_order', aggfunc='size', fill_value=0)
sns.heatmap(pivot_table, annot=True, cmap='YlGnBu', fmt='d')
plt.title('Heatmap')
plt.xlabel('Online Order')
plt.ylabel('Listed In (Type)')
plt.show()
